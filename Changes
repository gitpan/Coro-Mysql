Revision history for Perl extension Coro::Mysql

1.1   Sun Feb 20 11:34:38 CET 2011
	- implement a special EV mode, used when EV was available at build
          time AND is used by AnyEvent, otherwise fall back to Coro::Handle.
	- perl 5.10 or 5.12 breaks the syntax used in the with_db. fixed.

1.02  Wed Sep  1 18:37:48 CEST 2010
	- use xgptr everywhere, so it actually works on those newer
          systems.

1.01  Tue Aug 31 16:40:16 CEST 2010
	- gptr typedef is missing from newer libmysql, as
          pointed out by Yury Zavarin.

1.0   Sun Jun 21 02:56:05 CEST 2009
	- allow unblock calls on non-mysql handles as well
          (and return them unchanged).
        - unpatching was done too late durign destruction -
          hook diretcly into mysql's vio for that. saves memory
          and should be faster, even though neither will make a big
          difference :)
        - added a nice usage example using PApp::SQL 1.04.

0.1   Sat May 30 08:57:43 CEST 2009
	- first cpan upload.

0.01  Sun May 17 15:11:00 CEST 2009
	- original version; cloned from Convert::Scalar.
